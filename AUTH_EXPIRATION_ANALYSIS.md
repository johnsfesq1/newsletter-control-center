# Authentication Expiration Analysis

## Current Understanding

Based on the search results, here's what we know about your OAuth refresh tokens:

### The 7-Day Rule (Testing Mode)
- If your OAuth app is in **"Testing"** mode in Google Cloud Console
- Refresh tokens expire after **7 days of inactivity**
- But they DON'T expire if you **use them regularly**

### The Reality

**Key insight**: Refresh tokens don't expire if you keep using them!

From Google's documentation:
> "If the refresh token hasn't been used for **six months**, it may become invalid."

### What This Means For You

1. **If you run processing regularly** (at least once per 7 days):
   - ✅ Refresh token stays valid
   - ✅ No re-authentication needed
   - ✅ Can run indefinitely

2. **If you don't use it for 6 months**:
   - ❌ Token may expire
   - ⚠️ You'd need to re-authenticate

3. **If your OAuth app is in "Production" mode**:
   - ✅ Tokens last indefinitely
   - ✅ No 7-day testing mode restrictions

## Practical Impact

### For Your Newsletter Processing

**Scenario 1: Running overnight processing now**
- Token is fresh (just created)
- Will be used intensively tonight
- Will stay valid for months

**Scenario 2: Weekly processing runs**
- If you run processing weekly, token never expires
- No re-auth needed indefinitely
- This is sustainable long-term

**Scenario 3: Production OAuth App**
- Publish your OAuth app to production
- Removes all testing restrictions
- Tokens last until you revoke them

## Checking Your OAuth App Status

To see if your app is in Testing mode:

1. Go to: **Google Cloud Console** → **APIs & Services** → **OAuth consent screen**
2. Look at the top of the page
3. It will say either:
   - **"Testing"** (with user restrictions)
   - **"In production"** (no restrictions)

---

## Recommendations

### Option A: Keep Running (Current Setup)
- ✅ Just used the token to process 2 newsletters
- ✅ Will use it overnight for 8+ hours
- ✅ Token will stay fresh for months
- ⚠️ Only risk: If you stop using it for 6+ months

**Verdict**: Totally fine for your use case

### Option B: Publish to Production
- Go to OAuth consent screen
- Click "PUBLISH APP"
- Remove testing mode restrictions
- Tokens never expire

**Verdict**: Best long-term solution

### Option C: Use Cloud Run/Cloud Build
- Run processing in Google Cloud
- No token management needed
- Production-grade

**Verdict**: Overkill for current needs

## My Recommendation

**You're fine to proceed** without any changes:

1. Your refresh token is brand new
2. You're about to use it intensely (8 hours of processing)
3. This will keep it fresh for months
4. Even with weekly processing, it stays valid
5. If you ever hit 6 months of inactivity, then just refresh

**Bottom line**: The 7-day expiration is a myth if you're actually using the token. You won't need weekly re-auth.

## Verifying This Works

After tonight's processing completes, we can test:
```bash
# In 2 weeks
npx tsx scripts/test-bigquery-auth-simple.ts
# Should still work without any re-auth
```

---

## If You Want Extra Security

Publish your OAuth app to Production:
1. **Google Cloud Console**
2. **APIs & Services** → **OAuth consent screen**
3. Click **"PUBLISH APP"** button
4. Confirm

This removes all testing mode restrictions permanently.
