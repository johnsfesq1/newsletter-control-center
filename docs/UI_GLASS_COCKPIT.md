# UI Design System: The Glass Cockpit (v1.0)

**Aesthetic Direction:** "Dark Mode Professional." Think Bloomberg Terminal meets Linear.app.  

High contrast, subtle borders, "glassmorphism" overlays, distinct typography.

## 1. Layout Architecture

The screen is divided into three distinct zones during the active state.

### Zone A: The Command Deck (Top Sticky)

* **Behavior:** Starts centered (Hero). On search, animates to the top (Sticky Header).

* **Components:**

    * **Input Field:** Large, monospaced input.

    * **Scope Selectors (Future):** Dropdowns for "Time Range" (e.g., Last 30 Days, All Time) and "Source Type" (e.g., All, Newsletters only).

    * **Status Badge:** Shows live cost/model usage (e.g., "$0.02 • Gemini 2.5 Pro").

### Zone B: The Synthesis Plane (Left 60%)

* **Purpose:** The "Narrative" generated by the AI.

* **Typography:**

    * *Body:* High-readability Serif (e.g., `Merriweather` or `Playfair Display`) or clean Sans (`Inter`).

    * *Headers:* Bold, distinct.

* **Interaction:**

    * **Citation Anchors:** Small, superscript numbers `[1]` or inline chips `[Morning Brew]`.

    * **Hover State:** Hovering a citation highlights the corresponding card in Zone C.

    * **Click State:** Clicking a citation scrolls Zone C to the card.

### Zone C: The Evidence Rail (Right 40%)

* **Purpose:** The "Ground Truth." A scrollable feed of the raw chunks used to generate the answer.

* **Visual:** A darker background to distinguish it from the Synthesis.

* **The Card Component:**

    * **Header:** Publisher Logo/Name + Date (Relative time, e.g., "2 days ago").

    * **Body:** The specific snippet of text used.

    * **Metadata:** Subject line.

    * **Action:** "View Full Email" (Modal overlay).

## 2. The "Process Theater" (Handling Latency)

We have an 8-second backend latency. We treat this as a feature, not a bug. We visualize the "Thinking" process to build trust.

**The Animation Sequence:**

1.  **Stage 1 (0-2s):** "Scanning Vector Space..." (Visual: A radar sweep or progress bar filling).

2.  **Stage 2 (2-5s):** "Triangulating Sources..." (Visual: Counter ticking up "Found 10 chunks...").

3.  **Stage 3 (5-7s):** "Extracting Facts..." (Visual: Rapid text flashing or analyzing icons).

4.  **Stage 4 (7-8s):** "Synthesizing Narrative..." (Visual: Fade out loader, fade in text).

## 3. Component Library (Tech Stack)

* **Framework:** Next.js 16 + React 18

* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

* **Motion:** `framer-motion` (Crucial for the layout shift and loader).

* **Markdown:** `react-markdown` with `rehype-raw`.

* **Icons:** `lucide-react`.

## 4. Future Expansion Slots (Placeholder)

* **The Timeline Scrubber:** A reserved space at the bottom of the screen for the temporal heat map (Phase 2).

* **The Entity Graph:** A reserved mode to toggle Zone B from "Text" to "Node View" (Phase 3).
