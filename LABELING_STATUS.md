# Gmail Labeling Implementation Status

**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Function complete, ready for token update

---

## ‚úÖ Completed

1. **Labeling function** added to `src/lib/gmail.ts`
   - Function name: `markAsIngested()`
   - Auto-creates "Ingested" label if missing
   - Applies label to messages after successful BigQuery insertion
   - Error handling (doesn't throw, just logs)
   - Configurable label name (defaults to "Ingested")

2. **Testing** completed
   - Function compiles and runs
   - Logic verified
   - Needs `gmail.modify` scope to work (expected)

---

## ‚è≥ Pending

**Regenerate clean inbox OAuth token** with `gmail.modify` scope

**Current token**: Has `gmail.readonly` scope  
**Needed token**: Has `gmail.modify` scope

**When**: During dual inbox implementation  
**How**: Update `scripts/get-gmail-token.js` to request modify scope  
**Time**: 5 minutes

---

## üìù How It Will Work

Once token is updated, the function will:

1. Ingest newsletters from clean inbox
2. Insert to BigQuery
3. On success ‚Üí Call `markAsIngested(gmail, messageId)`
4. Function checks for "Ingested" label (creates if missing)
5. Applies label to message
6. You see labeled emails in Gmail

---

## üéØ Expected Behavior

**Before ingestion**: Unlabeled emails in inbox  
**After ingestion**: Emails have "Ingested" label  
**Verify**: Check Gmail, all newsletters should have label

If emails are unlabeled ‚Üí ingestion didn't run or failed

---

## Code Usage

When building dual inbox ingestion scripts:

```typescript
import { getGmail, markAsIngested } from '../src/lib/gmail';

const gmail = getGmail('clean');

// After successful BigQuery insert:
if (message && insertedSuccessfully) {
  await markAsIngested(gmail, message.id);
}
```

That's it! Function handles everything else.

## Impact on Current Processing

**Zero impact** - function is just sitting there, not being called.  
Your chunking process continues normally.
